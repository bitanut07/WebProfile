                <p>
                    I am currently pursuing an Early Childhood Education Diploma
                    at Humber Polytechnic. Through my studies, I have built a
                    strong foundation in child development, play-based learning,
                    and inclusive education. My experiences in classroom
                    observations, lesson planning, and interactive activities
                    have allowed me to support children's growth in meaningful
                    ways. I have also developed skills in responsive caregiving
                    and positive guidance to create safe and engaging learning
                    environments. I have a deep understanding of early learning
                    frameworks and child-centered teaching approaches. I value
                    collaboration with families and educators to provide
                    hands-on, developmentally appropriate experiences that
                    nurture children's curiosity, independence, and overall
                    well-being.

                Looking forward, I aim to create inclusive and supportive
                learning environments where all children feel valued and
                encouraged to explore. I am particularly passionate about
                integrating arts-based learning and creative expression into
                early education, using storytelling, music, and interactive play
                to enhance children's development. My goal is to make a lasting,
                positive impact by fostering a love for learning in a safe,
                engaging, and nurturing space.

            <p>
                I would like to acknowledge that I am a student studying at
                Humber College located on the traditional and Treaty 13, 1805
                lands of the Mississaugas of the Credit. This territory is also
                subject to the Dish with One Spoon Wampum, a covenant agreement
                between Anishinaabeg, Haudenosaunee, Wendat peoples and allied
                nations to peaceably share the land and all its resources.
